# 👻 My Ghostty Configuration

This directory contains my Ghostty configuration.
[Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty) is a modern, configurable,
cross-platform terminal emulator that supports GPU acceleration.

The Ghostty application expects user-defined configurations to reside inside the
`~/.config/ghostty/` directory, hence I have a symlink set up to link to my
local dotfiles version (`~/.config/ghostty/` -> `~/dotfiles/ghostty/`).

Custom themes such as Catppuccin are to reside within the `themes/` directory
of the config folder.
