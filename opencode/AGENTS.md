## Zotero library access

Read and write a Zotero library from the shell with the `zotero-cli` command - search papers by keyword or meaning, read PDF full text and page ranges, get and set metadata, manage collections, tags, notes and annotations, add items by DOI/URL/ISBN, and export bibliographies. Use whenever the user asks about their Zotero library, references, citations, papers they have saved, or their reading notes.

Read `~/.config/opencode/skills/zotero-cli/SKILL.md` before using it. Prefer it over the Zotero MCP server when you have shell access: the MCP tool schemas cost ~13k tokens of context on every request, this costs only what you run.

Quick check that it is set up: `zotero-cli config`. Pass `--json` whenever you will parse the output.
